Most of tourist Yerevan is concentrated in the city centre, which very compact and easily walkable, with endless dining and entertainment options. The rest of the city is mostly sleeping or business quarters, so a typical tourist will not have much incentive to leave the centre.

Kentron, Centre City, City Centre or Downtown - is central Yerevan, locally known as Kentron or just Kaghak (meaning 'the city'). This is the heart of Yerevan and indeed Armenia. Though Kentron's architecture is diverse, ranging from Belle Epoque to Soviet Panel blocks, the great majority of the centre is in Beaux-Arts tradition. The city centre follows Tamanyan's plan for a circular city with two hubs - grand Republic Square, and the more elegant and soft Opera district (Opera house, Freedom Square and the Swan Lake Park). The two are linked with newly constructed pedestrian-only Northern Avenue. Kentron is also home to the University City, where the campuses of State University, Medical University, Engineering University, Agricultural University, Economics University, Pedagogical and some other universities come together in one big group. Virtually all of the museums, hotels and popular places to eat and drink are in Kentron, so most visitors will probably not venture much past it.
Barekamutyun - Meaning friendship, Barekamutyun is the area around the metro stop of the same name. This hub is home to Hayastan Hanrakhanut (department store) which is more of an indoor bazaar than an actual department store. The hub branches off to Kievyan and nearby Komitas streets.
Monument - At the top of the Cascade steps rests the towering monument to Soviet victory in WWII. Directly adjacent is the Cafesjian Museum, which houses a large collection of contemporary art, including perhaps the best glass art collection in the world. Beyond the monument is Victory Park, and the neighborhood around it is known as Monument as well.
Erebuni - In this district are ruins of fortress of Erebuni, founded in 782 BC by King Argishti.
Bangladesh - Not to be confused with country in Asia! Not much to offer a tourist, the name however is worth an explanation. At the time this was one of the furthest new districts built in Yerevan, and because of the distance, locals quickly began calling it Bangladesh, which has stuck to this day. The biggest outdoor bazaar of Yerevan is located in this district.
Nor Nork district is the last Soviet project of residential expansion of Yerevan. It consists entirely of standardised Soviet Panel blocs. However, every tourist crosses this district on the way to 'obligatory' Garni temple and Geghard monastery (as the highway to that direction is connected to the main avenue of this district). The main attraction of this district would be the statue of Gay (or Hayk) Nahapet, the legendary founder of the nation; he's depicted as a muscular half-naked man with a drawn bow, but the name has nothing to do with homosexuality (to avoid this interesting misunderstanding most often the name of the avenue and statue is Romanised as Guy).MOST OF TOURIST YEREVAN IS CONCENTRATED IN THE CITY CENTRE, WHICH VERY COMPACT AND EASILY WALKABLE, WITH ENDLESS DINING AND ENTERTAINMENT OPTIONS. THE REST OF THE CITY IS MOSTLY SLEEPING OR BUSINESS QUARTERS, SO A TYPICAL TOURIST WILL NOT HAVE MUCH INCENTIVE TO LEAVE THE CENTRE.

KENTRON, CENTRE CITY, CITY CENTRE OR DOWNTOWN - IS CENTRAL YEREVAN, LOCALLY KNOWN AS KENTRON OR JUST KAGHAK (MEANING 'THE CITY'). THIS IS THE HEART OF YEREVAN AND INDEED ARMENIA. THOUGH KENTRON'S ARCHITECTURE IS DIVERSE, RANGING FROM BELLE EPOQUE TO SOVIET PANEL BLOCKS, THE GREAT MAJORITY OF THE CENTRE IS IN BEAUX-ARTS TRADITION. THE CITY CENTRE FOLLOWS TAMANYAN'S PLAN FOR A CIRCULAR CITY WITH TWO HUBS - GRAND REPUBLIC SQUARE, AND THE MORE ELEGANT AND SOFT OPERA DISTRICT (OPERA HOUSE, FREEDOM SQUARE AND THE SWAN LAKE PARK). THE TWO ARE LINKED WITH NEWLY CONSTRUCTED PEDESTRIAN-ONLY NORTHERN AVENUE. KENTRON IS ALSO HOME TO THE UNIVERSITY CITY, WHERE THE CAMPUSES OF STATE UNIVERSITY, MEDICAL UNIVERSITY, ENGINEERING UNIVERSITY, AGRICULTURAL UNIVERSITY, ECONOMICS UNIVERSITY, PEDAGOGICAL AND SOME OTHER UNIVERSITIES COME TOGETHER IN ONE BIG GROUP. VIRTUALLY ALL OF THE MUSEUMS, HOTELS AND POPULAR PLACES TO EAT AND DRINK ARE IN KENTRON, SO MOST VISITORS WILL PROBABLY NOT VENTURE MUCH PAST IT.
BAREKAMUTYUN - MEANING FRIENDSHIP, BAREKAMUTYUN IS THE AREA AROUND THE METRO STOP OF THE SAME NAME. THIS HUB IS HOME TO HAYASTAN HANRAKHANUT (DEPARTMENT STORE) WHICH IS MORE OF AN INDOOR BAZAAR THAN AN ACTUAL DEPARTMENT STORE. THE HUB BRANCHES OFF TO KIEVYAN AND NEARBY KOMITAS STREETS.
MONUMENT - AT THE TOP OF THE CASCADE STEPS RESTS THE TOWERING MONUMENT TO SOVIET VICTORY IN WWII. DIRECTLY ADJACENT IS THE CAFESJIAN MUSEUM, WHICH HOUSES A LARGE COLLECTION OF CONTEMPORARY ART, INCLUDING PERHAPS THE BEST GLASS ART COLLECTION IN THE WORLD. BEYOND THE MONUMENT IS VICTORY PARK, AND THE NEIGHBORHOOD AROUND IT IS KNOWN AS MONUMENT AS WELL.
EREBUNI - IN THIS DISTRICT ARE RUINS OF FORTRESS OF EREBUNI, FOUNDED IN 782 BC BY KING ARGISHTI.
BANGLADESH - NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH COUNTRY IN ASIA! NOT MUCH TO OFFER A TOURIST, THE NAME HOWEVER IS WORTH AN EXPLANATION. AT THE TIME THIS WAS ONE OF THE FURTHEST NEW DISTRICTS BUILT IN YEREVAN, AND BECAUSE OF THE DISTANCE, LOCALS QUICKLY BEGAN CALLING IT BANGLADESH, WHICH HAS STUCK TO THIS DAY. THE BIGGEST OUTDOOR BAZAAR OF YEREVAN IS LOCATED IN THIS DISTRICT.
NOR NORK DISTRICT IS THE LAST SOVIET PROJECT OF RESIDENTIAL EXPANSION OF YEREVAN. IT CONSISTS ENTIRELY OF STANDARDISED SOVIET PANEL BLOCS. HOWEVER, EVERY TOURIST CROSSES THIS DISTRICT ON THE WAY TO 'OBLIGATORY' GARNI TEMPLE AND GEGHARD MONASTERY (AS THE HIGHWAY TO THAT DIRECTION IS CONNECTED TO THE MAIN AVENUE OF THIS DISTRICT). THE MAIN ATTRACTION OF THIS DISTRICT WOULD BE THE STATUE OF GAY (OR HAYK) NAHAPET, THE LEGENDARY FOUNDER OF THE NATION; HE'S DEPICTED AS A MUSCULAR HALF-NAKED MAN WITH A DRAWN BOW, BUT THE NAME HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH HOMOSEXUALITY (TO AVOID THIS INTERESTING MISUNDERSTANDING MOST OFTEN THE NAME OF THE AVENUE AND STATUE IS ROMANISED AS GUY).
